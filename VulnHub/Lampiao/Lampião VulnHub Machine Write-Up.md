#Lampiao #VulnHub 

### 1. Introduction

* **Machine**: Lampi√£o
* **Difficulty**: (e.g., Easy/Medium/Hard)
* **OS/Service**:
* **Objective**: Capture the user and root flags.

### 2. Reconnaissance & Enumeration

#### 2.1 Network Scanning

* Tools used (e.g., Nmap)
* Command(s) and flags
* Open ports & services identified

#### 2.2 Service Enumeration

* HTTP
* SSH
* Other services
* Specific versions and potential vulnerabilities

---

### 3. Initial Foothold

* Vulnerability or misconfiguration exploited
* Exploit details or manual steps
* Commands used and output snippets
* Shell obtained: user or www-data

---

### 4. Privilege Escalation

#### 4.1 Local Enumeration

* Tools (e.g., LinEnum, linpeas)
* Interesting findings (e.g., SUID binaries, cron jobs, misconfigured services)

#### 4.2 Exploitation for Root

* Method or exploit used
* Commands and code snippets
* root shell obtained

---

### 5. Post-Exploitation

* Flags captured (user.txt, root.txt)
* Any additional pivoting, data exfiltration, or cleanup

---

### 6. Lessons Learned

* What went well?
* Challenges faced
* Techniques/tools to remember for future machines

---

### 7. References

* Links to official docs, exploit-db entries, blog posts, etc.
