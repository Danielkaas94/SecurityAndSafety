## The Planets: Earth 🌎🌍🌏 ✅🥇✅ 🌎🌍🌏

### [THE PLANETS: EARTH ~ VulnHub](https://www.vulnhub.com/entry/the-planets-earth,755/)

Difficulty: easy

Earth is an easy box though you will likely find it more challenging than "Mercury" in this series and on the harder side of easy, depending on your experience. There are two flags on the box: a user and root flag which include an md5 hash. This has been tested on VirtualBox so may not work correctly on VMware. Any questions/issues or feedback please email me at: SirFlash at protonmail.com, though it may take a while for me to get back to you.

Operating System: Linux

## The Planets: Venus ♀️♀️♀️ ✅🥇✅ ♀️♀️♀️

### [THE PLANETS: VENUS ~ VulnHub](https://www.vulnhub.com/entry/the-planets-venus,705/)

Difficulty: Medium

Venus is a medium box requiring more knowledge than the previous box, "Mercury", in this series. There are two flags on the box: a user and root flag which include an md5 hash. This has been tested on VirtualBox so may not work correctly on VMware. Any questions/issues or feedback please email me at: SirFlash at protonmail.com

## 💰💰💰 MoneyHeist - Catch Us If You Can 💰💰💰

### [MoneyHeist: Catch Us If You Can](https://www.vulnhub.com/entry/moneyheist-catch-us-if-you-can,605/)

Difficulty level: N\A

There is one flag, and you have to stop the heist. It is CTF like VM.
Here is a tip from my side:- keep Patience and do the enumeration process in a good manner.
Works better with VirtualBox.
If you want any hint, ping me anytime, and don't forget to share your feedback. I'll be glad :)
This works better with VirtualBox rather than VMware.

Operating System: Linux

## Corpvision 👨‍💼💼

### [Corpvision: 1 ~ VulnHub](https://www.vulnhub.com/entry/corpvision-1,691/)

*Disclaimer: I did not manage to get the root flag of this CTF* ❌🚩❌

Corpvision - Vision to your Future

Corpvision is a Company that hired Steven Smith, A Web Developer to create their website and now they hired you to test the security of their website. So Get, Set, and Go :)

Difficulty: Beginner to Intermediate

Tested On: Works well on VirtualBox, haven't tested on any other platforms.
Facing any issue or any suggestions, hit me up on Twitter at twitter/@thehackersbrain.

## Toppo 

### [Toppo: 1 ~ VulnHub](https://www.vulnhub.com/entry/toppo-1,245/)


The Machine isn't hard to own and don't require advanced exploitation .

Level : Beginner

DHCP : activated

Inside the zip you will find a vmdk file , and I think you will be able to use it with any usual virtualization software ( tested with Virtualbox).

If you have any question : my twitter is @h4d3sw0rm

Happy Hacking!

Operating System: Linux

## Is there a risk, if malware are inside these machines from VulnHub?

Short answer: yes, there is some risk. Not huge if you follow basic isolation rules, but VMs are not perfect sandboxes. Here’s what can go wrong and exactly what to do about it.

What can go wrong

* Malware can talk to the host over networks the VM and host share, for example host-only or bridged networks.
* Shared folders, clipboard sharing, and drag-and-drop are a common escape path for data exfiltration or accidental execution on the host.
* USB passthrough can let malware move to a USB device and from there infect other machines.
* NAT port forwarding or bridged adapters can expose the host or other LAN devices if misconfigured.
* Guest Additions increases attack surface. Vulnerabilities in VirtualBox or Guest Additions are rare but have happened.
* Malicious files you download into the VM can be opened on the host if you copy them out or mount host volumes.
* VMs can pivot to other VMs on the same virtual network if you run multiple targets.

How big the risk is

* For most VulnHub boxes the risk is moderate. Most are intentionally vulnerable services, not full-blown persistent malware.
* The real danger is operator error, for example enabling shared folders and then accidentally opening a malicious binary on the host.
* If you want absolute safety, use a physically separate machine or an ephemeral live environment. Otherwise follow the mitigations below.

Immediate, practical mitigations (do these now)

1. Disable shared folders, clipboard and drag-and-drop between host and VM.

   * In VirtualBox GUI: Settings -> General -> Advanced -> set Shared Clipboard = Disabled and Drag’n’Drop = Disabled. Remove any Shared Folders in Settings -> Shared Folders.
2. Avoid mounting host drives in the VM. Do not add Host Path shared folders.
3. Disable USB passthrough unless you explicitly need it.

   * In VirtualBox GUI: Settings -> USB -> uncheck/disable controllers.
4. Use host-only or internal network for lab traffic and avoid bridged networking.

   * For internet access use a separate NAT adapter only on the attacker VM. Keep targets on host-only or internal networks.
5. Do not enable NAT port forwarding unless you understand the exposure.
6. Don’t install Guest Additions in untrusted VMs. Guest Additions makes interaction easier but increases attack surface.
7. Revert to a clean snapshot after testing. Take a snapshot before starting, then restore when finished.
8. Run VMs under a non-admin user account on the host and keep host OS patched.
9. Use host firewall rules to block unexpected traffic from the VM network to the host or LAN. Example: block outgoing from vboxnet interface except what you explicitly allow.
10. Scan any files you intentionally transfer to the host with an updated AV or sandbox analyzer before opening them.
11. Isolate multiple lab VMs from each other unless you want them to communicate. Use separate internal networks for different exercises.

Extra-secure options

* Run the lab on a disposable physical machine or a Live Linux USB.
* Use a dedicated hypervisor with stronger isolation, for example a Type 1 hypervisor or a cloud sandbox.
* Run the VM inside another containment layer such as a QEMU/KVM VM that you throw away after use.

Quick checklist you can run now

* Settings -> Shared Folders: none listed.
* Settings -> General -> Advanced: Shared Clipboard = Disabled, Drag’n’Drop = Disabled.
* Settings -> USB: disabled.
* Networks: targets on Host-Only or Internal only. Attacker VM (Kali) gets NAT + Host-Only if you need Internet and lab access.
* Take snapshot: Machine -> Take Snapshot, name it CleanStart.

If you want, I can give step-by-step commands or GUI screenshots for any of the items above, or help you configure firewall rules for the host-only interface on your Windows host. Which mitigation would you like to apply first?
