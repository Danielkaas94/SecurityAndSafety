# Alright rant is over...
# Now let's demonstrate some basic bash features

set -x  # Enable debugging mode to print each command before executing it
# This is useful for understanding the flow of the script and for debugging.

whoami  # This command prints the current user

id     # This command prints the user ID and group ID of the current user

set +x  # Disable debugging mode


# Parameters in Bash
echo "The name of this script is: $0"  # $0 is the name of the script
echo "The first parameter is: $1"      # $1 is the first parameter passed to the script
echo "The second parameter is: $2"     # $2 is the second parameter passed to the script
echo "The total number of parameters is: $#"  # $# is the total number of parameters passed to the script
echo "All parameters are: $*"          # $* is all the parameters passed to the script





# Arrays in Bash
transport=('car' 'train' 'bike' 'bus')

# This will print all elements in the array 
echo "${transport[@]}"

# This will print the second element in the array (index starts at 0)
echo "${transport[1]}"

unset transport[2]  # This will remove the third element ('bike') from the array
echo "${transport[@]}"  # Print the array after removing an element

transport[2]='plane'  # This will add 'plane' as the third element in the array
echo "${transport[@]}"  # Print the array after adding an element



# Conditional Statements in Bash

# This conditional statement checks the value of the variable 'age' and prints a message based on its value.
if [ $age -lt 18 ]; then
    echo "You are a minor."
elif [ $age -ge 18 ] && [ $age -lt 65 ]; then
