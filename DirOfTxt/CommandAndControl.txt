"Command and Control" is one of the tactics within the MITRE ATT&CK framework. 
It focuses on the techniques that attackers use to establish communication channels 
between their compromised systems and their infrastructure. This communication allows 
them to manage and control their operations within the target environment. 
Here's a bit more detail about the Command and Control (C2) tactic:

**Command and Control:**
Command and Control involves techniques that adversaries employ to establish and 
maintain communication channels with their compromised systems. 
These channels are used to send instructions, receive commands, and exfiltrate data from the target environment. 
Attackers typically use these channels to manage their operations, update malicious software, and extract valuable information. 
Effective Command and Control is crucial for attackers to maintain persistence, carry out lateral movement, and execute their intended objectives.


Some techniques associated with the Command and Control tactic include:

- **Commonly Used Port:** Adversaries may use well-known ports and protocols (like HTTP, HTTPS, or DNS) 
to communicate, making their traffic appear more legitimate and blend in with regular network traffic.
  
- **Non-Standard Port:** Attackers might use non-standard ports and protocols for communication, 
making it harder for network security solutions to detect their activities.
  
- **Custom Command and Control Protocol:** Adversaries can develop their own communication protocols, 
making it even more challenging for defenders to identify malicious traffic.

- **Web Services:** Attackers may use web services, like cloud storage platforms, to exfiltrate data or receive instructions.
  
- **Remote File Copy:** Adversaries might use remote file copy techniques to transfer tools and payloads to compromised systems.

- **Third-Party Application:** Attackers may abuse third-party applications or services to establish communication channels, 
utilizing platforms that might be overlooked by security solutions.

Understanding the techniques within the Command and Control tactic is important for 
defenders to recognize and block malicious communication attempts. 
This can involve monitoring network traffic for unusual patterns, 
blocking known malicious domains or IP addresses, and using behavioral analysis to detect abnormal communication behavior.
