# Tell me about mimikatz

Mimikatz is a powerful open-source tool primarily used for retrieving and manipulating credentials in Windows operating systems. It was developed by Benjamin Delpy, a French security researcher. The tool is widely known for its ability to extract passwords, hashes, PINs, and other sensitive authentication data from memory, often in plaintext or easily crackable forms.

Mimikatz leverages various Windows security vulnerabilities and weaknesses to obtain credentials. It can access and parse data stored in the Windows Security Account Manager (SAM), Local Security Authority Subsystem Service (LSASS) memory, and Active Directory Domain Services.

Some of the common functionalities of Mimikatz include:

1. **Pass-the-Hash (PtH)**: Allows an attacker to authenticate to a system using NTLM hashes instead of clear text passwords.

2. **Pass-the-Ticket (PtT)**: Lets an attacker create and use Kerberos tickets to gain unauthorized access to systems.

3. **Over-Pass-the-Hash (oPtH)**: Extends PtH attacks by injecting credentials into the LSASS process.

4. **Golden Ticket**: Allows an attacker to forge Kerberos tickets and gain unrestricted access to a domain.

5. **Silver Ticket**: Enables the creation of forged Kerberos tickets for specific services or resources.

6. **DCSync**: Permits an attacker to simulate a Domain Controller (DC) and request account information from other DCs.

7. **Credential dumping**: Extracts various credentials stored in memory or the registry, including plaintext passwords and NTLM hashes.

Mimikatz has raised concerns within the cybersecurity community due to its potential misuse by malicious actors. However, it also serves a legitimate purpose by highlighting security weaknesses and promoting better security practices to defend against such attacks. As a cybersecurity student with an interest in penetration testing, understanding tools like Mimikatz is essential for assessing and improving system security.
