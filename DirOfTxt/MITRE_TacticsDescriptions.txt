MITRE ATT&CK is a framework used to categorize and describe various tactics, techniques, 
and procedures (TTPs) that adversaries use during cyberattacks. 
The framework provides a comprehensive and structured approach to understanding how attacks are executed. 
Here are brief descriptions of the different tactics within the MITRE ATT&CK framework:

1. **Initial Access:**
   This tactic involves the methods attackers use to gain a foothold in the target environment. 
   It includes techniques such as spear-phishing, exploiting vulnerabilities, and using social 
   engineering to trick users into executing malicious code.

2. **Execution:**
   Execution tactics encompass the techniques adversaries employ to run malicious code on 
   a victim's system. This can include executing payloads through methods like command-line 
   interfaces, scripting, or binary execution.

3. **Persistence:**
   Persistence tactics involve establishing mechanisms that allow attackers to maintain a 
   presence in the system even after a reboot or other disruptions. Techniques like creating 
   scheduled tasks, modifying registry keys, or installing malicious services fall under this category.

4. **Privilege Escalation:**
   Privilege escalation tactics focus on gaining higher levels of access within a compromised system. 
   Attackers employ techniques to exploit vulnerabilities, misconfigurations, or weak access controls 
   to elevate their privileges from standard user to administrator or system level.

5. **Defense Evasion:**
   Defense evasion tactics are used by adversaries to avoid detection by security tools and monitoring mechanisms. 
   This may include techniques such as using rootkits, obfuscating code, or tampering with security settings.

6. **Credential Access:**
   This tactic revolves around stealing, brute-forcing, or otherwise acquiring legitimate 
   credentials to gain unauthorized access. Attackers can exploit weak passwords, extract 
   credentials from memory, or use credential dumping tools.

7. **Discovery:**
   Discovery tactics involve techniques that attackers use to gather information about the target environment. 
   This includes querying system information, identifying network topology, and enumerating domain and user information.

8. **Lateral Movement:**
   Lateral movement involves moving laterally within a network to gain access to different systems and resources. 
   Attackers use techniques like remote desktop sessions, pass-the-ticket attacks, and exploiting trust relationships to move from one system to another.

9. **Collection:**
   Collection tactics focus on gathering data and sensitive information from the target environment. 
   Techniques include capturing screenshots, accessing email repositories, and exfiltrating documents.

10. **Exfiltration:**
    Exfiltration tactics cover methods used by adversaries to transfer stolen data out of the compromised environment. 
    This could involve techniques like encrypting and sending data over various network protocols.

11. **Impact:**
    Impact tactics are centered around causing damage or disruption to the target environment. 
    This might include techniques such as data destruction, system sabotage, and conducting denial-of-service attacks.

These tactics are further broken down into specific techniques that adversaries use to achieve their objectives. 
By understanding these tactics and techniques, defenders can better prepare to detect, prevent, and respond to cyberattacks.
