# Handling When Management Ignores Cybersecurity (NIS2 Context)

[Danish version](./Handling_when_management_ignores_security_DK.md)

## Purpose
This document outlines a professional and ethical approach if an organization's leadership fails to take the necessary responsibility for information security according to the **NIS2 Directive** and **ISO 27001**.  
The goal is to ensure that security work is anchored at the top management level, as required by the directive.

---

## 1. Management Responsibility under NIS2
**NIS2, Articles 20 and 21**, stipulate that:
- Top management has **overall responsibility** for cybersecurity governance.  
- Management must **approve policies**, **risk assessments**, and **controls**.  
- Management must **receive and respond** to security incident reports.  
- Failure to act can result in **personal liability** and **fines**.

| Requirement | Description | Reference |
|-------------|-------------|-----------|
| Management responsibility | Management must actively approve and oversee security initiatives | NIS2 Art. 20(1) |
| Competence requirement | Management must be educated in cybersecurity | NIS2 Art. 20(2) |
| Governance & risk management | The organization must have clear processes and roles | NIS2 Art. 21(2)(a) |
| Incident reporting | Significant incidents must be reported to the supervisory authority | NIS2 Art. 23 |

---

## 2. Typical Signs of Lack of Management Commitment
- Security is treated as a purely IT issue.  
- Risk assessments or awareness programs are postponed or ignored.  
- No clear prioritization of security projects or allocation of resources.  
- Lack of clear communication from management about the importance of security.  
- No reporting or follow-up on incidents.

---

## 3. Recommended Approach

### Step 1 – Document the Facts
Keep a factual log of observations or incidents:
- Date, situation, and context.  
- Relevant emails, meeting notes, or reports.  
- References to NIS2 requirements potentially being violated.

**Purpose:** to create traceability, not to assign blame.

---

### Step 2 – Professional Internal Dialogue
Attempt internal discussion first by raising concerns professionally:

> “I am concerned that we may not fully comply with NIS2 Article 21, which requires management engagement. Could we discuss how to ensure management has oversight of the most critical risks?”

Focus on **risk and solutions**, not blame.

---

### Step 3 – Involve Support Functions
If the issue persists, contact relevant internal roles:
- DPO or Information Security Coordinator  
- Internal Audit  
- Legal Department  
- HR (if personnel management or behavior is involved)

These functions can help elevate the issue systematically and neutrally.

---

### Step 4 – Whistleblower (Last Resort)
If there are still **material violations of law**, or citizens’/users’ data is at risk, use the organization’s **whistleblower channel**.  
NIS2 requires that all affected entities have a procedure that ensures **anonymity and protection against retaliation**.

---

## 4. Possible Consequences of Non-Compliance
- **Fines** and financial penalties.  
- **Personal liability** for management in case of negligence.  
- **Supervisory actions** from the Danish Agency for Digitisation or sector-specific authorities.  
- **Loss of trust** from citizens, partners, and auditors.  

---

## 5. Learning and Improvement Perspective
The aim of this approach is to create a **constructive security culture**:
- Security becomes a **shared responsibility**, not just an IT problem.  
- Management gains **oversight and ownership** of risks.  
- The organization becomes **more resilient** and compliant.
