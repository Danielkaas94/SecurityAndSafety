# Misconceptions and Clarifications – ChatGPT Summary

### [Danish version of this document](./Misforståelser_og_Afklaringer.md)

*Alright, there’s something I need to clarify... NIS2 and ISO 27001 — You can’t get fined or punished if you’re in the process of meeting the requirements, right?  
As long as there’s visible progress in security? Or are companies under heavy pressure to fully comply? There are limits to how many controls you can implement in a year.*

Excellent question — and you’ve hit directly on something that many organizations are struggling with right now 💡  

Let’s separate it into two parts: **NIS2** and **ISO 27001**, because there’s an important difference.

---

### 🧭 **NIS2 (Legislation = Legal Obligation)**

NIS2 is **law**, not a voluntary framework like ISO 27001.  
This means that **organizations within scope can face fines or enforcement actions**, *but only if they fail to meet requirements — **and** show negligence.*

👉 **However:**  
If an organization can **document** that it is systematically and seriously working towards compliance (i.e. has a plan, roadmap, risk assessments, and clear progress), it is *very rare* for authorities to sanction them.

> What typically leads to sanctions is **inaction** – not being in progress.

**In short:**

* ❌ Ignoring the requirements → risk of fines.  
* ✅ Documented progress, governance, and prioritised effort → authorities are satisfied.

**Fine levels (indicative from the EU directive):**

* For *essential entities*: up to **€10 million** or **2% of global turnover**.  
* For *important entities*: up to **€7 million** or **1.4% of global turnover**.  
  But again – these are *maximums* and only relevant in cases of *gross negligence* (e.g. data breach due to no monitoring or incident handling).

---

### 📘 **ISO 27001 (Voluntary Standard)**

ISO 27001 is a **voluntary certification**.  
There are **no legal fines** for being halfway there – it’s about maturity.  
A certification body will simply note **“minor”** or **“major non-conformities”**, which you can correct later.

---

### ⚙️ **The Reality for Most Companies Right Now**

Most organizations are still in the process of:

* Mapping their **gaps** against NIS2 and/or ISO 27001,  
* Developing **roadmaps** (typically 12–24 months),  
* Prioritising the most critical controls first (e.g. risk management, incident handling, vendor management, awareness).

So yes — you’re absolutely right:

> “There are limits to how many controls you can implement in a year.”

That’s 100% correct.  
Therefore, **progress and documentation** are more important than perfection.

## ⚠️ Common Misconceptions about NIS2 and ISO 27001

### 1. **“We must be ISO 27001 certified to comply with NIS2.”**

❌ **Incorrect.**  
NIS2 does not require ISO 27001 certification.  
✅ However, ISO 27001 can be used as a **framework** to demonstrate compliance — they overlap significantly.

> **In short:** ISO 27001 is a tool, not a requirement.

---

### 2. **“We’ll be fined if we’re not done by the deadline.”**

❌ **Incorrect.**  
NIS2 focuses on *due diligence* – showing that you **take responsibility and work systematically**.  
✅ The key is to document **progress**: risk analysis, action plan, and ongoing implementation of controls.

> You get sanctioned for inaction, not for being in progress.

---

### 3. **“NIS2 only applies to governments and critical infrastructure.”**

❌ **Partly wrong.**  
NIS2 also applies to **private companies** in *important* sectors (energy, transport, health, finance, digital infrastructure, etc.).  
✅ It also affects **suppliers** to these entities, through **third-party risk management**.

> Many SMEs only realise they’re indirectly covered when customers start requiring NIS2 compliance in contracts.

---

### 4. **“The IT department can handle it.”**

❌ **Incorrect.**  
NIS2 and ISO 27001 are about **management responsibility** and **governance**, not just technology.  
✅ They require involvement from **executives and boards**, who must document responsibility, risk assessments, and decisions.

> It’s a management project with technical elements – not the other way around.

---

### 5. **“We must have everything in place at once.”**

❌ **Incorrect.**  
✅ It’s far better to work **risk-based and incrementally**.  
Start with the most critical areas: incident handling, access control, and backup.

> Maturity over time is a strength – not a weakness.

---

### 6. **“NIS2 is only about cybersecurity.”**

❌ **Partly wrong.**  
NIS2 is also about **organizational resilience**: governance, supplier management, awareness, reporting, and more.  
✅ It’s both a *cybersecurity and leadership directive*.

> It’s about making the organization robust – not just the network secure.

---

### 7. **“NIS2 is the same in every EU country.”**

❌ **Incorrect.**  
The EU directive is uniform, but **national implementations differ**.  
✅ In Denmark, it will be enforced through the **Cy**
