# NIS2 Compliance Notes

This folder contains my personal notes, resources, and code snippets related to the **NIS2 Directive** and its implementation.

## 📖 Overview
The NIS2 Directive (Network and Information Security 2 - EU Directive 2022/2555) is the EU-wide legislation on cybersecurity, aimed at achieving a high common level of cybersecurity across the Union. It replaces the original NIS Directive (2016).

Key points:
- Expands the scope to more sectors and entities.
- Introduces stricter supervisory measures and enforcement requirements.
- Sets out obligations for risk management and incident reporting.
- Enhances supply chain security and cooperation across Member States.
