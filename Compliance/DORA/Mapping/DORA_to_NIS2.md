# 🔗 DORA ↔ NIS2 Mapping

## Purpose
This document provides a **cross-reference mapping** between the **Digital Operational Resilience Act (DORA)** and the **NIS2 Directive**.  
Both frameworks aim to enhance the cybersecurity and resilience of critical sectors across the EU.  
DORA focuses on **financial entities**, while NIS2 applies more broadly to **essential and important entities**.

This mapping highlights where requirements **align**, **partially overlap**, or **differ**, to support unified compliance strategies.

| Symbol | Meaning |
|---------|----------|
| ✅ | Full alignment / identical requirement |
| ⚙️ | Partial overlap / similar intent |
| ⚠️ | Related but with notable differences |
| ❌ | Not applicable / no equivalent requirement |

## 📘 Mapping Table

| **DORA Article** | **Title / Summary** | **NIS2 Article / Section** | **Alignment** | **Notes** |
|------------------|---------------------|-----------------------------|----------------|------------|
| **Art. 5–14** | ICT Risk Management Framework | **Art. 21** — Cybersecurity risk management measures | ✅ | Both require governance, policies, and proportional ICT controls. |
| **Art. 15–20** | ICT-related Incident Reporting | **Art. 23–24** — Incident reporting obligations | ✅ | DORA specifies financial reporting chains; NIS2 applies to all sectors. |
| **Art. 21–24** | Digital Operational Resilience Testing | **Art. 21(2)(e)** — Testing of risk management measures | ⚙️ | NIS2 testing is general; DORA mandates TLPT for critical entities. |
| **Art. 25–39** | Third-Party Risk Management | **Art. 21(2)(d)** — Supply chain security | ⚙️ | Both require supplier risk oversight; DORA adds contractual obligations. |
| **Art. 40–45** | Information Sharing Arrangements | **Art. 26** — Cyber threat information sharing | ✅ | Both encourage voluntary exchange of threat intelligence. |
| **Art. 46–56** | Oversight of Critical ICT Providers | **Art. 32–33** — Supervision and enforcement | ⚠️ | DORA establishes direct EU-level oversight for critical ICT providers. |

## 🧩 Observations

- **Governance & Accountability**: Both frameworks emphasize management responsibility and risk ownership.  
- **Incident Handling**: DORA requires a structured financial reporting chain; NIS2 allows more national flexibility.  
- **Third-Party Oversight**: DORA is stricter, mandating exit strategies and contract clauses.  
- **Testing**: DORA introduces **Threat-Led Penetration Testing (TLPT)** — a key differentiator.  
- **Scope**: NIS2’s scope is broader (energy, transport, health, etc.), while DORA is specialized for finance.
