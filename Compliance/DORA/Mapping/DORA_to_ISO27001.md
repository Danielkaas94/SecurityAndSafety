# üîó DORA ‚Üî ISO/IEC 27001:2022 Mapping

## Purpose
Cross-reference mapping that shows how key DORA requirements (Regulation (EU) 2022/2554) map to ISO/IEC 27001:2022 clauses and Annex A controls.  
This is designed to help you demonstrate how an implemented ISMS (ISO 27001) supports DORA compliance ‚Äî and where gaps will likely remain (e.g., TLPT, EU supervisory powers, mandatory reporting templates). :contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0}

## Legend

| Symbol | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| ‚úÖ | Strong alignment ‚Äî ISO clause/control covers the DORA requirement when properly implemented |
| ‚öôÔ∏è | Partial overlap ‚Äî ISO provides the intent or baseline but not the full DORA specificity |
| ‚ö†Ô∏è | Related but notable gap ‚Äî ISO does not mandate the DORA-specific requirement (e.g., EU supervisory powers, TLPT mandates) |
| ‚ùå | Not applicable / no ISO equivalent |

---

## High-level Observations (load-bearing)
- **ISO/IEC 27001:2022 provides a strong foundation for ICT risk management, governance, incident handling and supplier controls** ‚Äî making it a practical base for DORA readiness. :contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}  
- **DORA adds prescriptive, sector-specific obligations not contained in ISO**: mandatory incident reporting templates/timelines to competent authorities, TLPT obligations for certain entities, and an EU oversight regime for critical ICT third-party providers. Those items are usually gaps to address beyond ISO. :contentReference[oaicite:2]{index=2}

## Mapping Table (selected DORA topics ‚Üí ISO27001)

| **DORA area / Articles** | **Short summary** | **ISO/IEC 27001:2022 (Clause / Annex A)** | **Alignment** | **Notes / How to show evidence** |
|--------------------------|-------------------|--------------------------------------------|---------------|----------------------------------|
| **Governance & Accountability** (Arts. 5‚Äì6) | Board-level ICT risk governance, roles, policies | Clauses 5‚Äì10 (Leadership, Planning, Operation); Annex A.5 (Organisational controls: roles & responsibilities). | ‚úÖ | Use ISMS scope, roles matrix, board minutes, policy framework and SoA to show board accountability and documented responsibilities. :contentReference[oaicite:3]{index=3} |
| **ICT Risk Management Framework** (Arts. 7‚Äì14) | Risk identification, assessment, controls lifecycle | Clause 6 (Planning), Clause 8 (Operation), Annex A controls across Organizational/Technological sets (risk treatment, asset management, vulnerability mgmt). | ‚úÖ | Risk register, risk assessment methodology (ISO 27005 alignment), SoA mapping of Annex A controls to risks. :contentReference[oaicite:4]{index=4} |
| **Incident Management & Reporting** (Arts. 15‚Äì20) | Detection, classification, internal & external reporting obligations | Annex A.5/Org controls + Annex A techn. controls (logging, monitoring) and Clause 9 (performance eval). ISO A.16-ish objectives (incident mgmt) ‚Äî implemented as incident mgmt processes. | ‚öôÔ∏è | ISO supports incident management (playbooks, testing). **Gap:** DORA requires specific regulatory reporting timelines, templates and escalation to competent authorities ‚Äî include regulator-specific reporting runbooks and evidence of test reporting. :contentReference[oaicite:5]{index=5} |
| **Digital Operational Resilience Testing (incl. TLPT)** (Art. 26) | Routine testing + threat-led penetration testing (TLPT) for certain entities | Annex A (penetration testing, vulnerability mgmt, continuity tests) ‚Äì generic testing controls. | ‚ö†Ô∏è | ISO expects security testing but **does not mandate TLPT frequency/RTS-style governance**. For DORA: add TLPT programme, Rules of Engagement, independent red teams, kill-switches, and TLPT evidence. See TLPT guidance. :contentReference[oaicite:6]{index=6} |
| **Third-Party ICT Risk & Oversight** (Arts. 25‚Äì39) | Due diligence, contracts, monitoring, concentration risk; oversight of critical ICT providers | Annex A.5 (organizational), Annex A.15 (Supplier relationships / third-party controls in 2013 mapping) and multiple organizational controls in Annex A 2022 (procurement, supplier lifecycle). | ‚öôÔ∏è | ISO covers supplier controls (due diligence, contracts). **Gap:** DORA requires contractual clauses enabling regulator access and a Union-level oversight regime for CTPPs ‚Äî include contract addenda, concentration risk register, and evidence of third-party monitoring. :contentReference[oaicite:7]{index=7} |
| **Operational Resilience / Business Continuity** (various Arts) | RTO/RPO, recovery plans, testing | Annex A: continuity & backup controls, operation clause, change management controls | ‚úÖ | Use BCP/DR documents, restore test reports and evidence of RTO/RPO metrics in board reporting as proof. :contentReference[oaicite:8]{index=8} |
| **Logging, Monitoring & Detection** | Central logging, SIEM, MTTD/MTTR metrics | Annex A technological controls (access logging, monitoring, detection) | ‚úÖ | SIEM dashboards, alerts, detection KPIs, SOC runbooks, SIEM tuning records. |
| **Information Sharing / Threat Intelligence** (Art. 40‚Äì45) | Voluntary sharing of threat info | Annex A controls for information exchange & communications; Clause 7 support (awareness/competence) | ‚öôÔ∏è | ISO covers controlled info sharing practices ‚Äî produce sharing agreements, TS/TP channels and evidence of membership in ISACs or voluntary sharing protocols. |
| **Documentation, Recordkeeping & Evidence** | Incident logs, test reports, contracts, SoA | Clause 7 (Support ‚Äî documented info), Clause 9 (Performance evaluation), Annex A controls | ‚úÖ | ISO already requires documented info and audit trails ‚Äî include DORA-specific templates in doc repository. :contentReference[oaicite:9]{index=9} |
| **Supervisory / EU-level Oversight** (Arts. 31‚Äì41) | Designation, oversight and enforcement powers over critical ICT providers | **No direct ISO equivalent** (legal/regulatory supervisory regime) | ‚ùå | This is a regulatory regime (EBA/Joint Committee oversight). Demonstrate alignment by keeping evidence for authorities (audit logs, supplier contracts allowing supervisory access) ‚Äî but ISO cannot replace the legal obligations. :contentReference[oaicite:10]{index=10} |

## Practical implementation guidance (quick wins)
1. **SoA + Addenda**: Expand your ISMS Statement of Applicability (SoA) to explicitly reference DORA requirements and where Annex A controls are used to meet them; add a DORA column (Implemented / Partial / Gap) for audits. :contentReference[oaicite:11]{index=11}  
2. **Regulatory Runbooks**: Create regulator-specific incident reporting runbooks that map ISO incident categories to DORA reporting thresholds and templates. (Keep tabletop exercise evidence.) :contentReference[oaicite:12]{index=12}  
3. **TLPT Roadmap**: Where TLPT applies, build a TLPT roadmap (scoping, engagement model, independent red team roster, assurance evidence) and cross-reference it from Annex A testing controls. :contentReference[oaicite:13]{index=13}  
4. **Third-party contract clauses**: Add DORA-compliant clauses (audit rights, data portability, continuity, supervisory access) to supplier templates and maintain a concentration-risk register. :contentReference[oaicite:14]{index=14}
