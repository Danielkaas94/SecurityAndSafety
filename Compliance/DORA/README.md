# 🧩 DORA — Digital Operational Resilience Act (EU Regulation 2022/2554)

## Overview
The **Digital Operational Resilience Act (DORA)** establishes a unified regulatory framework to strengthen the digital resilience of the **EU financial sector**.  
It ensures that all financial entities — including banks, investment firms, insurers, and ICT providers — can **withstand, respond to, and recover from ICT-related disruptions and cyber threats**.

DORA entered into force on **January 16, 2023**, and becomes **applicable from January 17, 2025**.

---

## 🎯 Objective
To create a harmonized approach to **ICT risk management, incident reporting, testing, third-party oversight**, and **information sharing**, ensuring operational continuity in the financial ecosystem.

## 🧱 Core Framework Pillars

| Pillar | Description |
|--------|--------------|
| **ICT Risk Management** | Establish and maintain governance, risk management, and control frameworks to identify, assess, and mitigate ICT risks. |
| **Incident Management & Reporting** | Detect, classify, and report ICT-related incidents to competent authorities using harmonized procedures. |
| **Digital Operational Resilience Testing** | Implement regular testing of systems, including **Threat-Led Penetration Testing (TLPT)** every 3 years for critical entities. |
| **Third-Party Risk Management** | Ensure proper oversight and contractual governance over ICT service providers and outsourcing arrangements. |
| **Information Sharing** | Enable voluntary information exchange between entities on cyber threats, vulnerabilities, and defensive measures. |

## ⚖️ DORA vs Other Frameworks

| Framework | Scope | Overlap with DORA |
|------------|--------|------------------|
| **NIS2** | Broad critical sectors (energy, transport, healthcare, etc.) | Shared focus on cybersecurity risk and reporting obligations. |
| **ISO/IEC 27001** | General ISMS framework for any organization | Provides the baseline controls DORA expects for ICT risk management. |
| **CIS Controls v8** | Technical control set | Offers practical mappings for resilience, detection, and incident response. |
