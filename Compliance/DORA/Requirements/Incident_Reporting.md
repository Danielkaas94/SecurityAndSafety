**DORA — ICT-Related Incident Management & Reporting**

## Purpose
Establish procedures to detect, classify, manage, communicate and report ICT-related incidents to the competent authority and, where relevant, to clients and other stakeholders.

## Scope
All ICT-related incidents that affect confidentiality, integrity, availability or continuity of critical or important services.

## Core Requirements (derived from DORA — Articles 15–20)
1. **Incident Management Lifecycle**
   - Detection → Classification (severity/impact) → Containment → Eradication → Recovery → Lessons Learned.
   - Maintain an incident playbook and runbooks for priority incidents.

2. **Classification & Thresholds**
   - Implement incident classification criteria aligned to DORA’s categories (major, substantial, non-substantial) and local competent authority thresholds.
   - Escalate major incidents to senior management immediately.

3. **Reporting Obligations & Timelines**
   - Report significant incidents to the competent authority using the single reporting framework required by DORA (initial notification and follow-up information).  
   - Ensure internal timelines for internal notification (first hour/first 24 hours) and for external reporting in line with DORA/RTS (see national competent authority templates). :contentReference[oaicite:3]{index=3}

4. **Content of Reports**
   - Report must include: description of the incident, impact (affected services, number of clients), root cause (if known), mitigation measures, and action plan. Keep evidence and timelines.

5. **Communication & Stakeholder Management**
   - Pre-defined communication templates for regulators, customers, and public statements. Coordinate with legal, PR, and data protection teams (GDPR considerations).

6. **Recordkeeping**
   - Maintain an incident register with evidence, timelines, decisions and post-incident reviews.

7. **Testing Incident Response**
   - Tabletop exercises and live incident simulations (after action reviews) at least annually; test escalation and regulatory reporting flows.

## Practical Templates (examples to include in this folder)
- Incident Report Template (initial + follow-up).  
- Internal escalation checklist.  
- Regulator notification mapping (who, where, how).
