**DORA — Third-Party ICT Risk & Critical ICT Providers**

## Purpose
Establish oversight, contractual and operational controls for ICT third-party relationships, including identification and management of critical third-party ICT providers (CTPPs).

## Scope
All outsourcing, cloud, managed services, software-as-a-service (SaaS), platform providers and other ICT suppliers.

## Core Requirements (derived from DORA — Articles 25–39)
1. **Inventory & Categorisation**
   - Maintain a third-party registry capturing service description, criticality, contract dates, SLAs, sub-processor visibility, data classification and exit strategy.

2. **Risk-Based Due Diligence**
   - Perform security, resilience and legal due diligence prior to onboarding. Use questionnaires, audits, certifications (ISO27001, SOC2) and penetration test evidence.

3. **Contractual Requirements**
   - Contracts must include security and resilience clauses: service levels, incident reporting obligations, audit rights, access for competent authorities (where required), termination/exit clauses, data portability & recovery obligations.

4. **Ongoing Monitoring**
   - Continuous/periodic monitoring of third-party performance, vulnerability exposure, dependency mapping and SLAs. Trigger risk re-assessment on major changes.

5. **Concentration Risk & Aggregation**
   - Identify concentration risk (e.g., multiple entities depending on the same provider). Where a provider could be designated as a critical third-party ICT provider (CTPP), coordinate with the competent authority’s oversight framework (EBA/EIOPA/ESMA roles). :contentReference[oaicite:9]{index=9}

6. **Exit & Contingency Planning**
   - Maintain exit plans, data retrieval processes and alternate providers for critical services. Test migrations and recovery steps periodically.

7. **Audit & Onsite Rights**
   - Preserve the right to audit or request independent assurance; maintain a process to remediate vendor-side findings.
