**DORA — Governance, Oversight & Audit Requirements**

## Purpose
Ensure robust governance and assurance mechanisms covering ICT risk management, reporting and third-party oversight, with board-level oversight and appropriate internal/external audit coverage.

## Scope
Corporate governance structures, internal audit, compliance, risk functions, and external audit interplay.

## Core Requirements (derived from DORA — Titles I–V)
1. **Board & Senior Management Oversight**
   - Board-level visibility (regular reporting, KPIs, risk appetite linked to ICT) and defined escalation paths. Ensure competence in digital resilience at senior level.

2. **Policies & Documentation**
   - Maintain enterprise policies covering ICT risk, incident reporting, testing, third-party management and business continuity; version control and periodic review cadence.

3. **Internal Audit**
   - Internal audit must include ICT risk coverage with scope, frequency and resource allocation proportionate to the entity’s risk profile. Audit should review implementation of DORA obligations and remedial actions.

4. **Independent Assurance**
   - Use external audits/assessments and independent assurance to validate control effectiveness (e.g., external penetration tests, SOC reports, audit of incident management and TLPT process).

5. **Regulatory Liaison**
   - Maintain a regulatory engagement plan (who communicates with competent authority, templates, timelines). Keep records for supervisory reviews and oversight processes.

6. **Training & Awareness**
   - Mandatory training for relevant staff (incident response, security basics, supplier management). Board-level briefings at least annually.

7. **Continuous Improvement**
   - Post-incident and post-test lessons-learned process with tracked improvements and verification of remediation.

## Metrics & Reporting to Board
- Regular board pack sections: ICT risk top 10, incidents summary, remediation backlog, TLPT/testing status, third-party criticality and concentration risk.
