## 🧠 Implementation Tips

- Enforce **least privilege access** across all systems.  
- Maintain an **up-to-date asset inventory** to track devices and systems.  
- Perform **regular penetration testing and vulnerability scans**.  
- Implement **centralized logging** and SIEM for monitoring.  
- Backup critical data with **offsite or cloud redundancy**.
