# Annex A.5 ‚Äî Organizational Controls

## üß≠ Overview

Annex A.5 introduces organizational-level security controls that define governance, policies, and risk management responsibilities across the ISMS.

These controls ensure that information security is properly managed, documented, and integrated into the organization‚Äôs overall management framework.

## üîë Control Areas

| Control ID | Title | Summary |
|------------|-------|---------|

| **Control 5.3** | Segregation of duties | Separate duties and privileges to reduce risk of error, fraud or unauthorized access; implement checks and compensating controls where full segregation is not possible. |
| **Control 5.4** | Management responsibilities | Require top management to demonstrate leadership and commitment through resource allocation, review, and visible support for ISMS activities. |
| **Control 5.5** | Contact with authorities | Maintain formal or informal contact channels with relevant legal, regulatory and law-enforcement bodies for reporting or consultation when needed. |
| **Control 5.6** | Contact with special interest groups | Participate in industry CERTs/ISACs, working groups or vendor community channels to receive guidance, advisories and share best practices. |
| **Control 5.7** | Threat intelligence | Collect, validate and act on threat intelligence (internal and external feeds) to inform risk assessments, detection rules and proactive defenses. |
| **Control 5.8** | Information security in project management | Integrate security requirements into projects (requirements, design reviews, acceptance criteria) and include security gate(s) in project lifecycle. |
| **Control 5.9** | Inventory of information and other associated assets | Maintain an up-to-date asset inventory (data, systems, services, hardware, software) with owners and classification to support risk management. |
| **Control 5.10** | Acceptable use of information and other associated assets | Define and communicate acceptable use rules for systems and data (user responsibilities, prohibited actions, monitoring and enforcement). |
| **Control 5.11** | Return of assets | Ensure procedures for return of organisational assets (devices, credentials, keys, documents) on termination, role change or contract end. |
| **Control 5.12** | Classification of information | Define information classification scheme (e.g., public/internal/confidential/secret) and associated handling rules and retention periods. |
| **Control 5.13** | Labelling of information | Apply consistent labelling or metadata for classified information to support correct handling, sharing and protection measures. |
| **Control 5.14** | Information transfer | Protect information in transit (internal and external) using appropriate controls‚Äîencryption, secure channels, transfer agreements and checklists. |
| **Control 5.15** | Access control | Establish access control policies and mechanisms (least privilege, role-based access, access reviews) for systems and data. |
| **Control 5.16** | Identity management | Manage identities lifecycles (provisioning, deprovisioning, change) and tie identity processes to HR or supplier events. |
| **Control 5.17** | Authentication information | Protect authentication material (password policies, secrets storage, MFA, secure handling of keys and tokens). |
| **Control 5.18** | Access rights | Implement processes to assign, review and revoke access rights; log changes and require documented approvals. |
| **Control 5.19** | Information security in supplier relationships | Define security requirements for third parties, including risk assessment, onboarding checks and ongoing monitoring. |
| **Control 5.20** | Addressing information security within supplier agreements | Ensure contracts include security clauses (SLAs, audit rights, incident notification, data handling and return/destruction). |
| **Control 5.21** | Managing information security in the ICT supply chain | Identify critical suppliers, assess supply-chain risks, apply minimum-security standards and require transparency on subcontracting. |
| **Control 5.22** | Monitoring, review and change management of supplier service | Monitor supplier performance and security; require change-notification processes and re-assessment for significant changes. |
| **Control 5.23** | Information security for use of cloud services | Apply cloud-specific controls: shared-responsibility model, configuration hardening, encryption, tenancy isolation and provider assessments. |
| **Control 5.24** | Information security incident management planning and preparation | Maintain incident response plans, roles, runbooks, communications templates and tabletop exercises to ensure readiness. |
| **Control 5.25** | Assessment and decision on information security events | Define triage and assessment procedures to decide if an event is an incident, its severity and escalation path. |
| **Control 5.26** | Response to information security incidents | Carry out containment, eradication and recovery actions per the incident plan; coordinate communications and legal/reporting obligations. |
| **Control 5.27** | Learning from information security incidents | Conduct post-incident reviews or after-action reports, capture root causes and incorporate lessons into controls and training. |
| **Control 5.28** | Collection of evidence | Preserve logs, snapshots, chain-of-custody and forensic data with documented procedures to support investigation or legal action. |
| **Control 5.29** | Information security during disruption | Apply continuity controls for security during business disruptions (alternate processing, secure remote work, prioritized recovery). |
| **Control 5.30** | ICT readiness for business continuity | Ensure critical ICT systems have documented recovery objectives, tested backups, failover options and restoration procedures. |
| **Control 5.31** | Legal, statutory, regulatory and contractual requirements | Identify and track applicable legal and contractual obligations (data protection, sector rules) and maintain compliance evidence. |
| **Control 5.32** | Intellectual property rights | Protect IP through access controls, NDAs, code protection practices and monitoring for IP leakage. |
| **Control 5.33** | Protection of records | Ensure records (including backups) are protected, retained per policy, and that access and integrity are preserved. |
| **Control 5.34** | Privacy and protection of PII | Implement controls for personal data: lawful basis, minimization, DPIAs, secure processing and data subject rights handling. |
| **Control 5.35** | Independent review of information security | Conduct periodic independent assessments (internal audit, external audit, third-party review) to validate control effectiveness. |
| **Control 5.36** | Compliance with policies, rules and standards for information security | Monitor and enforce compliance with internal policies and external standards; use audits, reviews and disciplinary measures as needed. |
| **Control 5.37** | Documented operating procedures | Maintain documented, approved procedures for routine operations, change, backup, incident handling and supplier interactions. |

## üß† Implementation Tips

- Define **policy ownership** and update intervals (e.g., annually or upon major change).
- Maintain an **ISMS RACI matrix** for clarity on responsibilities.
- Consider joining relevant **CERT/ISAC** or security community groups.
- Include **threat intelligence feeds** or advisories (e.g., ENISA, CISA).
