# Clause 6 — Planning

## 🎯 Purpose
The Planning clause ensures the organization identifies and manages risks and opportunities that could impact the ISMS’s intended outcomes.  
It establishes the foundation for **risk assessment**, **risk treatment**, and **security objectives** that guide implementation and improvement efforts.

---

## 🔍 Key Requirements

1. **Actions to Address Risks and Opportunities**  
   - Determine issues that could affect the achievement of ISMS goals.  
   - Plan actions to mitigate risks and leverage opportunities.

2. **Information Security Risk Assessment**  
   - Establish and apply a structured process for identifying, analyzing, and evaluating information security risks.  
   - Define risk criteria (likelihood, impact, acceptance levels).  
   - Ensure consistent and repeatable assessments.

3. **Information Security Risk Treatment**  
   - Select appropriate controls to manage identified risks (often referencing Annex A).  
   - Develop a **Statement of Applicability (SoA)** linking risks to chosen controls.  
   - Create and maintain a **Risk Treatment Plan (RTP)** for follow-up actions.

4. **Information Security Objectives and Planning to Achieve Them**  
   - Define measurable objectives aligned with the organization’s security policy and risk management outcomes.

## 🧠 Implementation Tips

- Use a **risk register** to track identified risks, their owners, and mitigation measures.  
- Review risk assessments **at least annually**, or when significant changes occur.  
- Keep the **Statement of Applicability (SoA)** updated — auditors always request it.  
- Ensure objectives are **SMART** (Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, Time-bound).
