## 🎯 Purpose
Clause 9 ensures that the ISMS’s performance is **monitored, measured, analyzed, and evaluated** to confirm that objectives are achieved and improvements are identified.

## 🔍 Key Requirements

1. **Monitoring, Measurement, Analysis, and Evaluation**  
   - Define what, how, and when to measure.  
   - Include risk status, compliance, incidents, and effectiveness of controls.

2. **Internal Audit**  
   - Conduct audits to assess compliance with ISO 27001 requirements.  
   - Audit results should drive corrective actions.

3. **Management Review**  
   - Top management must review ISMS performance at planned intervals.  
   - Review inputs: audit results, incidents, risk status, and improvement opportunities.  
   - Review outputs: decisions and actions on improvements, resource allocation, and policy updates.
