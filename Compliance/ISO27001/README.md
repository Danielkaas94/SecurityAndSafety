# ISO/IEC 27001: Information Security Management System (ISMS)

ISO/IEC 27001:2022 defines the requirements for establishing, implementing, maintaining, and continually improving an Information Security Management System (ISMS).  
It provides a structured approach to managing sensitive company information, ensuring it remains secure through a balance of **people**, **processes**, and **technology**.
