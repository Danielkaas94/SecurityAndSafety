## CIS Control 11: Data Recovery

### üéØ Purpose

Develop and implement **data recovery processes** to ensure that critical information can be restored following data loss, corruption, ransomware attack, or system failure.

The goal is to maintain **business continuity** and minimize downtime by having reliable backups and recovery procedures.

---

### üß© Key Principles

* **Resilience:** Ensure critical data can be recovered quickly and completely.
* **Regular Backups:** Maintain up-to-date copies of essential data and configurations.
* **Testing:** Verify backup integrity and restore procedures regularly.
* **Segregation:** Protect backup data from unauthorized access and malware.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Implementation Steps

| Step     | Description                                                                                                   |
| -------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **11.1** | Identify **critical systems, applications, and data** for backup and recovery.                                |
| **11.2** | Establish backup procedures, including frequency, retention, and storage location (on-site, off-site, cloud). |
| **11.3** | Encrypt backups and restrict access to authorized personnel only.                                             |
| **11.4** | Regularly test backup restoration to validate integrity and ensure procedures work as intended.               |
| **11.5** | Maintain **offline or immutable backups** to protect against ransomware and accidental deletion.              |
| **11.6** | Document recovery time objectives (RTO) and recovery point objectives (RPO) for all critical systems.         |
| **11.7** | Integrate data recovery planning into incident response and business continuity plans.                        |

### üß∞ Example Tools

* **Backup Solutions:** Veeam, Acronis, Duplicati, BorgBackup, AWS Backup
* **Disaster Recovery:** Zerto, Veeam Disaster Recovery Orchestrator, Azure Site Recovery
* **Immutable Storage:** WORM drives, object storage with versioning and immutability features

---

### üß† Best Practices

* Maintain **multiple backup copies** in geographically separate locations.
* Periodically **audit backup logs** to ensure completion and integrity.
* Include **configuration files and system images** in backups, not just data.
* Implement **role-based access** to backup and recovery systems.
* Regularly **review RTO and RPO objectives** to align with evolving business needs.

### üîí Mappings to Other Frameworks

| Framework              | Reference                 | Description                                                                    |
| ---------------------- | ------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **NIS2**               | Annex I ‚Äì Risk Management | Ensures resilience and continuity of critical network and information systems. |
| **ISO/IEC 27001:2022** | A.8.3, A.17.1             | Backup and recovery of information; business continuity management.            |
| **NIST CSF**           | PR.IP-4 / PR.DS-4         | Backups are performed, protected, and periodically tested for recovery.        |

### üìä Example Policy Snippet

```text
Critical systems and data must be backed up according to approved backup schedules.  
Backups must be encrypted, protected from unauthorized access, and stored off-site or in an immutable format.  
Restoration tests must be conducted quarterly to verify backup integrity and recovery procedures.
```
