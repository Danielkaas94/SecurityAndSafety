## CIS Control 13: Security Awareness and Skills Training

### üéØ Purpose

Develop and implement a **security awareness and training program** to ensure that all personnel understand cybersecurity risks and can act to reduce them.

The goal is to **empower users and staff** to recognize threats, follow policies, and contribute to the organization‚Äôs security posture.

### üß© Key Principles

* **Education:** Users must understand common threats (phishing, social engineering, malware).
* **Role-Based Training:** Staff should receive training relevant to their job responsibilities.
* **Continuous Learning:** Regular updates and refresher courses keep skills current.
* **Measurement:** Assess effectiveness through testing, simulations, and feedback.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Implementation Steps

| Step     | Description                                                                                     |
| -------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **13.1** | Develop a **security awareness program** covering threats, policies, and best practices.        |
| **13.2** | Provide **role-specific training** for system administrators, developers, and privileged users. |
| **13.3** | Conduct **regular phishing simulations** and social engineering tests.                          |
| **13.4** | Evaluate user comprehension through quizzes, tests, or practical exercises.                     |
| **13.5** | Update training materials regularly to address new threats and technologies.                    |
| **13.6** | Integrate security awareness into onboarding and offboarding processes.                         |
| **13.7** | Maintain records of training completion and effectiveness metrics for compliance.               |

### üß∞ Example Tools

* **Security Awareness Platforms:** KnowBe4, Cofense, Infosec IQ
* **Phishing Simulations:** PhishMe, AttackSim, GoPhish
* **Learning Management Systems (LMS):** Moodle, TalentLMS, Microsoft Viva Learning

---

### üß† Best Practices

* Tailor training to **different departments and job functions**.
* Reinforce awareness with **regular communications**, such as newsletters or security tips.
* Track **behavior changes** and simulate attacks to measure effectiveness.
* Reward or recognize employees who demonstrate good security practices.
* Integrate **security culture** into daily operations, not just training sessions.

### üìä Example Policy Snippet

```text
All personnel must complete mandatory security awareness training upon onboarding and annually thereafter.  
Role-specific training must be provided to privileged users, administrators, and developers.  
Phishing simulations will be conducted quarterly to evaluate user awareness and response, and results will inform ongoing training.
```
