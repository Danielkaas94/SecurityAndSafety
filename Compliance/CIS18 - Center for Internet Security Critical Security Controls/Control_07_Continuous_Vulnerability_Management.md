## CIS Control 07: Continuous Vulnerability Management

### 🎯 Purpose

Continuously **identify, assess, and remediate vulnerabilities** in enterprise systems, applications, and network devices to reduce the attack surface and prevent exploitation by threat actors.

The goal is to maintain a **proactive security posture**, addressing weaknesses before they can be leveraged in an attack.

---

### 🧩 Key Principles

* **Continuous Scanning:** Vulnerabilities must be identified on an ongoing basis, not just periodically.
* **Prioritization:** Focus remediation on vulnerabilities that pose the highest risk.
* **Remediation:** Promptly address vulnerabilities through patching, configuration changes, or compensating controls.
* **Verification:** Ensure that remediation is effective and verified.

### ⚙️ Implementation Steps

| Step    | Description                                                                                                         |
| ------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **7.1** | Establish an **inventory of all systems, software, and network devices** to ensure complete vulnerability coverage. |
| **7.2** | Deploy automated **vulnerability scanning tools** to identify known vulnerabilities.                                |
| **7.3** | Continuously monitor vendor and security advisories for new vulnerabilities.                                        |
| **7.4** | Prioritize vulnerabilities based on **CVSS score, asset criticality, and threat exposure**.                         |
| **7.5** | Apply patches or mitigation strategies promptly according to risk prioritization.                                   |
| **7.6** | Validate remediation efforts by rescanning systems and verifying fixes.                                             |
| **7.7** | Maintain vulnerability management records for auditing and compliance purposes.                                     |

### 🧰 Example Tools

* **Vulnerability Scanners:** Nessus, OpenVAS, Qualys, Rapid7 Nexpose
* **Patch Management:** Microsoft WSUS, SCCM, Ivanti, ManageEngine Patch Manager
* **Threat Intelligence:** US-CERT alerts, NVD, vendor advisories
* **Automation & Orchestration:** Ansible, SaltStack, Puppet for patch deployment

---

### 🧠 Best Practices

* Integrate vulnerability scanning with **asset management** to ensure full coverage.
* Use **risk-based prioritization** to focus remediation on high-impact vulnerabilities first.
* Combine **authenticated and unauthenticated scans** for comprehensive results.
* Regularly test remediation procedures in **staging environments** before deployment.
* Track **vulnerability trends over time** to measure program effectiveness.

### 📊 Example Policy Snippet

```text
All enterprise systems and applications must be scanned for known vulnerabilities at least weekly.  
Critical vulnerabilities must be remediated within 7 days, high within 14 days, and medium/low according to risk-based prioritization.  
All remediation actions must be verified and documented.
```
