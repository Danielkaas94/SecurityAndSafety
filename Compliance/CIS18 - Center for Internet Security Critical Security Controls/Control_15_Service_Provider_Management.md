## CIS Control 15: Service Provider Management

### üéØ Purpose

Establish processes to **assess, monitor, and manage the security of service providers** and third-party vendors to reduce risks introduced by external partners.

The goal is to **ensure that third parties maintain security practices** consistent with the organization‚Äôs requirements and regulatory obligations.

---

### üß© Key Principles

* **Due Diligence:** Evaluate security posture before onboarding vendors.
* **Contractual Security Requirements:** Include security expectations and responsibilities in agreements.
* **Continuous Monitoring:** Track vendor security performance and compliance over time.
* **Incident Coordination:** Ensure vendors can report and respond to security incidents promptly.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Implementation Steps

| Step     | Description                                                                                                         |
| -------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **15.1** | Maintain an **inventory of all service providers** and classify them based on risk and criticality.                 |
| **15.2** | Conduct **security assessments** before engaging new vendors (questionnaires, audits, certifications).              |
| **15.3** | Include **security requirements in contracts**, including data protection, incident reporting, and access controls. |
| **15.4** | Periodically review and reassess vendor security posture through audits or evidence of compliance.                  |
| **15.5** | Monitor vendor performance and incidents, integrating findings into risk management processes.                      |
| **15.6** | Require vendors to notify the organization of **security incidents** within agreed timelines.                       |
| **15.7** | Terminate contracts or restrict access for vendors failing to meet security requirements.                           |

### üß∞ Example Tools

* **Vendor Risk Management Platforms:** BitSight, SecurityScorecard, RiskRecon
* **Contract Management:** DocuSign CLM, Icertis, Concord
* **Assessment & Audit Tools:** Shared Assessments Standardized Information Gathering (SIG), questionnaires, audit checklists

---

### üß† Best Practices

* Classify vendors by **risk impact** to focus on critical third parties.
* Use **continuous monitoring tools** to track external exposure and security performance.
* Integrate **vendor security assessments** into procurement and contract renewal processes.
* Include **right-to-audit clauses** in contracts for high-risk vendors.
* Establish **incident response coordination** plans with key vendors.

### üìä Example Policy Snippet

```text
All service providers must be evaluated for security risk prior to engagement.  
Contracts must include security requirements, incident reporting obligations, and access controls.  
Vendors will be periodically reassessed, and failure to meet security standards may result in access termination or contract cancellation.
```
