## CIS Control 17: Incident Response Management

### 🎯 Purpose

Establish a formal **incident response (IR) program** to prepare for, detect, respond to, and recover from cybersecurity incidents, minimizing damage and reducing recovery time.

The goal is to **ensure organizational resilience** and an effective, repeatable response to threats and breaches.

---

### 🧩 Key Principles

* **Preparation:** Develop policies, procedures, and trained personnel for incident handling.
* **Detection:** Identify and analyze incidents quickly using monitoring and alerting systems.
* **Containment & Mitigation:** Limit the impact of incidents and prevent further damage.
* **Recovery:** Restore normal operations and evaluate lessons learned.

### ⚙️ Implementation Steps

| Step     | Description                                                                                                  |
| -------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **17.1** | Develop an **incident response plan (IRP)** outlining roles, responsibilities, and procedures.               |
| **17.2** | Establish an **incident response team (IRT)** with clearly defined roles.                                    |
| **17.3** | Implement monitoring and alerting to **detect incidents** across systems and networks.                       |
| **17.4** | Classify and **prioritize incidents** based on impact and severity.                                          |
| **17.5** | Contain and mitigate incidents using pre-defined strategies.                                                 |
| **17.6** | Perform **forensic analysis** to determine root cause and scope of incidents.                                |
| **17.7** | Recover systems and data to normal operation, following business continuity procedures.                      |
| **17.8** | Conduct **post-incident reviews** to identify lessons learned and update policies, procedures, and training. |

### 🧰 Example Tools

* **SIEM & Alerting:** Splunk, QRadar, ELK Stack
* **Forensics:** Autopsy, EnCase, FTK
* **Endpoint Detection & Response (EDR):** CrowdStrike Falcon, SentinelOne, Microsoft Defender for Endpoint
* **Communication & Collaboration:** ServiceNow, Jira, Slack integrations for IR workflow

---

### 🧠 Best Practices

* Conduct **regular incident response exercises** (tabletop and live simulations).
* Integrate incident response with **threat intelligence** for proactive mitigation.
* Maintain **communication plans** for internal stakeholders, regulators, and customers.
* Document **lessons learned** and update procedures continuously.
* Test recovery plans periodically to ensure **resilience and readiness**.

### 📊 Example Policy Snippet

```text
An incident response plan must be maintained, including roles, responsibilities, and procedures for detection, containment, and recovery.  
All security incidents must be reported immediately to the incident response team, documented, and reviewed post-incident.  
Regular exercises and simulations must be conducted to ensure team readiness and procedure effectiveness.
```
