## CIS Control 10: Malware Defenses

### üéØ Purpose

Establish, deploy, and maintain defenses against **malware** to prevent, detect, and remediate infections on enterprise systems and networks.

The goal is to **reduce the risk of compromise** from viruses, ransomware, spyware, and other malicious software.

---

### üß© Key Principles

* **Prevention:** Block malware from entering enterprise systems.
* **Detection:** Identify malware infections quickly through monitoring and analysis.
* **Response:** Remove malware and remediate affected systems promptly.
* **Continuous Improvement:** Update defenses to address emerging threats.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Implementation Steps

| Step     | Description                                                                                       |
| -------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **10.1** | Deploy anti-malware solutions on all endpoints, servers, and critical systems.                    |
| **10.2** | Configure automated updates for malware signatures and detection engines.                         |
| **10.3** | Use **network-level defenses** to block malicious content and command-and-control traffic.        |
| **10.4** | Implement application whitelisting to prevent unauthorized or unknown software execution.         |
| **10.5** | Monitor and analyze security events for signs of malware infection.                               |
| **10.6** | Conduct periodic **malware scans** and verify system integrity.                                   |
| **10.7** | Ensure an incident response plan is in place for malware detection, containment, and remediation. |

### üß∞ Example Tools

* **Endpoint Protection:** Microsoft Defender, CrowdStrike Falcon, Sophos, Bitdefender
* **Network Security:** Firewalls, Intrusion Prevention Systems (IPS), Secure Web Gateways
* **Application Whitelisting:** AppLocker, Carbon Black, OS native policies
* **Sandboxing & Threat Analysis:** Cuckoo Sandbox, FireEye, VirusTotal

---

### üß† Best Practices

* Combine **signature-based and behavior-based detection** for comprehensive coverage.
* Use **network segmentation** to contain malware outbreaks.
* Regularly test and update malware defenses to address new attack vectors.
* Educate users to **avoid suspicious downloads and attachments**.
* Integrate malware defenses with **SIEM and incident response workflows**.

### üîí Mappings to Other Frameworks

| Framework              | Reference                 | Description                                                                            |
| ---------------------- | ------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **NIS2**               | Annex I ‚Äì Risk Management | Protects network and information systems from malware threats.                         |
| **ISO/IEC 27001:2022** | A.8.7, A.12.2             | Protect against malware, including preventive and corrective controls.                 |
| **NIST CSF**           | PR.DS-5 / DE.CM-7         | Malware is prevented, detected, and remediated; endpoint and network defenses applied. |

---

### üìä Example Policy Snippet

```text
All endpoints, servers, and critical systems must have approved anti-malware software installed and updated automatically.  
Systems shall be scanned regularly for malware, and any detected threats must be remediated within 24 hours.  
Application whitelisting must be enforced to prevent unauthorized software execution.
```
