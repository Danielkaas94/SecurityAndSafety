## CIS Control 16: Application Software Security

### üéØ Purpose

Implement security measures throughout the **software development lifecycle (SDLC)** to prevent vulnerabilities, reduce exploitation risk, and ensure applications are secure by design.

The goal is to **minimize software-related risks** and protect sensitive data from attacks such as injection, XSS, and insecure authentication.

---

### üß© Key Principles

* **Secure Design:** Integrate security into architecture and design phases.
* **Secure Coding Practices:** Follow standards and guidelines to prevent common vulnerabilities.
* **Testing & Verification:** Perform static, dynamic, and penetration testing.
* **Deployment Security:** Harden applications and enforce access controls before production.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Implementation Steps

| Step     | Description                                                                                                                  |
| -------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **16.1** | Establish a **secure software development lifecycle (SSDLC)** with security requirements included from design to deployment. |
| **16.2** | Use **secure coding standards** (e.g., OWASP Top Ten) and conduct developer training.                                        |
| **16.3** | Perform **code reviews and static application security testing (SAST)** before deployment.                                   |
| **16.4** | Conduct **dynamic application security testing (DAST)** and penetration testing on live applications.                        |
| **16.5** | Integrate **automated vulnerability scanning** into CI/CD pipelines.                                                         |
| **16.6** | Ensure **secure configuration** and patching of application servers and frameworks.                                          |
| **16.7** | Maintain an **inventory of applications** and their versions for patch management and risk assessment.                       |

---

### üß∞ Example Tools

* **Static Code Analysis:** SonarQube, Checkmarx, Fortify, Veracode
* **Dynamic Testing:** OWASP ZAP, Burp Suite, Netsparker
* **Dependency & Open Source Scanning:** Snyk, Dependabot, WhiteSource
* **CI/CD Integration:** GitHub Actions, Jenkins, GitLab CI with security plugins

---

### üß† Best Practices

* Train developers in **secure coding practices** regularly.
* Include **security requirements in user stories and design documents**.
* Automate **security testing** wherever possible to reduce human error.
* Use **least privilege** for application accounts and services.
* Track and remediate **third-party library vulnerabilities** promptly.

### üîí Mappings to Other Frameworks

| Framework              | Reference                 | Description                                                          |
| ---------------------- | ------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **NIS2**               | Annex I ‚Äì Risk Management | Ensures software security measures reduce risks to critical systems. |
| **ISO/IEC 27001:2022** | A.14.2, A.14.3            | Security requirements in development, secure coding, and testing.    |
| **NIST CSF**           | PR.IP-3 / PR.DS-1         | Applications are developed securely and vulnerabilities are managed. |

### üìä Example Policy Snippet

```text
All applications must follow a secure software development lifecycle including design, coding, testing, and deployment phases.  
Code must be reviewed and scanned for vulnerabilities before production.  
Open-source and third-party components must be tracked, patched, and verified for security compliance.
```
